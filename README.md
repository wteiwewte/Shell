# Shell
Simple implementation of POSIX shell

## Information

This project was made during Operating Systems course. 
Its goal was to implement simple shell. 
In this version are included e.g. background processes, redirections and simple commands like 'cd' or 'ls'.

### Installing and running

Just type 'make' in the /src directory.
Then type './mshell' and feel free to write a couple of basic shell commands.

### Tests

Shell was tested on both MINIX 3.2.1 and Ubuntu 16.04.

## Note

A couple of files, in particular those related to raw parsing input were provided by my tutor
